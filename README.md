# multiple-cursors-clipboard package

Monkey patch Atom to offer proper multicursors clipboard handling

__WARNING: This package is a proof of concept that essentially hacks Atom classes to offer what I think should be the behavior of clipboard from multiple cursors. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS PACKAGE WILL NOT BREAK AFTER AN ATOM UPDATE, as it's dependent of the Atom's Editor and Selection implementation.__
